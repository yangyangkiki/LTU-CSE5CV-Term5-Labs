However, even within this simple rule there is nuance. A well known example is the contrast between Americans and Russians when it comes to smiling. Americans are known for smiling as a show of goodwill. If you do not smile in the US, generally you are communicating that there is something wrong. In contrast, Russians generally reserve smiling for when there is actually something worth smiling about. And that's just between cultures, there's a lot of variation between individuals (e.g. temperament, neurodiversity) and contexts too.\n",

That is, determining emotion from facial expression - whether by human or machine - is not known to be accurate or reliable.\n",
